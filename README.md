# climate-app

This app was built using streamlit and the Pharos API. It displays a variety of time-series data from ERA5 (produced by the ECMWF), including temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation.

If you would like to run/modify the code, you will need an API key from Pharos. Please sign-up here: https://pharossoftware.com/
